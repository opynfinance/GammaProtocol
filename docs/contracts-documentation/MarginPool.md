token decimals in Controller before being passed to MarginPool

### `transferToUser(address _asset, address payable _user, uint256 _amount)` (public)

transfers asset from pool to user

all tokens are scaled to have 1e18 precision in contracts, but are scaled to native

token decimals in Controller before being passed to MarginPool

all tokens are scaled to have 1e18 precision in contracts, but are scaled to native

token decimals in Controller before being passed to MarginPool

### `farm(address _asset, address _receiver, uint256 _amount)` (external)

function to collect excess balance

can only be called by farmer address

### `setFarmer(address _farmer)` (external)

Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token

contract returns false). Tokens that return no value (and instead revert or

throw on failure) are also supported, non-reverting calls are assumed to be

successful.

To use this library you can add a `using SafeERC20 for ERC20Interface;` statement to your contract,

which allows you to call the safe operations as `token.safeTransfer(...)`, etc.

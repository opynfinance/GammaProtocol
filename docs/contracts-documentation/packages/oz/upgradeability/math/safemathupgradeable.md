# `SafeMathUpgradeable`

Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow

checks.

Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result

in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an

error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.

`SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an

operation overflows.

Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire

class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.

## Functions:

- `add(uint256 a, uint256 b) (internal)`

- `sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) (internal)`

- `sub(uint256 a, uint256 b, string errorMessage) (internal)`

- `mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) (internal)`

- `div(uint256 a, uint256 b) (internal)`

- `div(uint256 a, uint256 b, string errorMessage) (internal)`

- `mod(uint256 a, uint256 b) (internal)`

- `mod(uint256 a, uint256 b, string errorMessage) (internal)`

### Function `add(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256 internal`

Returns the addition of two unsigned integers, reverting on

overflow.

Counterpart to Solidity's `+` operator.

Requirements:

- Addition cannot overflow.

### Function `sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256 internal`

Returns the subtraction of two unsigned integers, reverting on

overflow (when the result is negative).

Counterpart to Solidity's `-` operator.

Requirements:

- Subtraction cannot overflow.

### Function `sub(uint256 a, uint256 b, string errorMessage) → uint256 internal`

Returns the subtraction of two unsigned integers, reverting with custom message on

overflow (when the result is negative).

Counterpart to Solidity's `-` operator.

Requirements:

- Subtraction cannot overflow.

### Function `mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256 internal`

Returns the multiplication of two unsigned integers, reverting on

overflow.

Counterpart to Solidity's `*` operator.

Requirements:

- Multiplication cannot overflow.

### Function `div(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256 internal`

Returns the integer division of two unsigned integers. Reverts on

division by zero. The result is rounded towards zero.

Counterpart to Solidity's `/` operator. Note: this function uses a

`revert` opcode (which leaves remaining gas untouched) while Solidity

uses an invalid opcode to revert (consuming all remaining gas).

Requirements:

- The divisor cannot be zero.

### Function `div(uint256 a, uint256 b, string errorMessage) → uint256 internal`

Returns the integer division of two unsigned integers. Reverts with custom message on

division by zero. The result is rounded towards zero.

Counterpart to Solidity's `/` operator. Note: this function uses a

`revert` opcode (which leaves remaining gas untouched) while Solidity

uses an invalid opcode to revert (consuming all remaining gas).

Requirements:

- The divisor cannot be zero.

### Function `mod(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256 internal`

Returns the remainder of dividing two unsigned integers. (unsigned integer modulo),

Reverts when dividing by zero.

Counterpart to Solidity's `%` operator. This function uses a `revert`

opcode (which leaves remaining gas untouched) while Solidity uses an

invalid opcode to revert (consuming all remaining gas).

Requirements:

- The divisor cannot be zero.

### Function `mod(uint256 a, uint256 b, string errorMessage) → uint256 internal`

Returns the remainder of dividing two unsigned integers. (unsigned integer modulo),

Reverts with custom message when dividing by zero.

Counterpart to Solidity's `%` operator. This function uses a `revert`

opcode (which leaves remaining gas untouched) while Solidity uses an

invalid opcode to revert (consuming all remaining gas).

Requirements:

- The divisor cannot be zero.

# `CountersUpgradeable`

Provides counters that can only be incremented or decremented by one. This can be used e.g. to track the number

of elements in a mapping, issuing ERC721 ids, or counting request ids.

Include with `using Counters for Counters.Counter;`

Since it is not possible to overflow a 256 bit integer with increments of one, `increment` can skip the {SafeMath}

overflow check, thereby saving gas. This does assume however correct usage, in that the underlying `_value` is never

directly accessed.

## Functions:

- `current(struct CountersUpgradeable.Counter counter) (internal)`

- `increment(struct CountersUpgradeable.Counter counter) (internal)`

- `decrement(struct CountersUpgradeable.Counter counter) (internal)`

### Function `current(struct CountersUpgradeable.Counter counter) â†’ uint256 internal`
